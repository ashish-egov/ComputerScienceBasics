# ComputerScienceBasics

## Early Computing

-   Mechanical devices such as the abacus and  Jacquard loom  were the first computers.
-   Charles Babbage designed the  Analytical Engine, the first programmable machine.
-   Ada Lovelace is credited with creating the first  computer program  for the Analytical Engine.
-   Alan Turing described the  Universal Turing Machine, capable of performing any computation.
-   The first electronic computer,  ENIAC, was built in the 1940s to calculate  ballistic trajectories.

## Electronic Computing

-   The development of the transistor paved the way for the miniaturization of electronic components and the creation of the modern computer.
-   The first commercially successful computer was the  UNIVAC, introduced in the 1950s.
-   IBM dominated the computer industry in the 1960s with its System/360 mainframe computer.
-   The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s allowed for the creation of personal computers.

## Boolean Logic & Logic Gates

-   Boolean logic  is a system of logic based on two values: true and false.
-   Logic gates  are electronic circuits that implement Boolean logic.
-   The three basic logic gates are AND, OR, and NOT.
-   Other logic gates include NAND, NOR, XOR, and  XNOR.
-   Logic gates can be combined to create more complex circuits, such as adders  and  flip-flops.

## Representing Numbers and Letters with Binary

-   Binary is a  number system  based on two values: 0 and 1.
-   Computers use  binary  to represent numbers and letters.
-   ASCII is a standard  encoding scheme  that assigns a unique  binary code  to each character.
-   Unicode is a more comprehensive encoding scheme that supports a wider range of characters and languages.

## How Computers Calculate - the ALU

-   The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a component of the computer that performs arithmetic and  logical operations.
-   The ALU operates on  binary numbers  using logic gates and circuits.
-   The ALU can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and  bitwise operations.
-   The ALU is controlled by the computer's central processing unit (CPU).

## Registers and RAM

-   Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold data temporarily.
-   RAM  (Random Access Memory) is the primary memory of a computer, which can be read from and written to.
-   RAM is volatile, meaning that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off.
-   Accessing data in RAM is slower than accessing data in registers, but much faster than accessing data from secondary storage devices like hard drives.

## The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

-   The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.
-   The CPU consists of an  arithmetic logic unit  (ALU), control unit (CU), and registers.
-   The CU fetches instructions from memory and decodes them into operations the ALU can perform, then sends the results back to memory or registers.
-   The clock speed of a CPU measures how many instructions it can execute per second.

## Instructions & Programs

-   Programs are a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
-   Instructions are encoded in binary and stored in memory.
-   The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the process by which the CPU retrieves instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them.
-   High-level programming languages allow programmers to write code in a more human-readable form, which is then translated into  machine code  by a compiler or interpreter.

## Advanced CPU  Designs

-   Pipelining  is a technique used by modern CPUs to execute multiple instructions simultaneously, by overlapping the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
-   Superscalar processors can execute  multiple instructions  in parallel by having multiple execution units.
-   Branch prediction  is a technique used by modern CPUs to predict which branch of code will be executed next, in order to minimize the number of cycles wasted on incorrect predictions.
-   Cache is a small, fast memory located on the  CPU chip  that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the amount of time spent accessing main memory.

## Early Programming

-   Early programming languages were often low-level and difficult to use, requiring programmers to write instructions in binary or  assembly language.
-   Grace Hopper invented the first compiler, which allowed programmers to write code in a higher-level language that was then automatically translated into machine code.
-   FORTRAN was the first high-level programming language, designed for scientific and engineering applications.
-   COBOL was designed for business applications, while  BASIC  was designed for beginners.

## First Programming Languages

-   The  first programming languages  were developed in the 1950s and 1960s.
-   Some of the earliest  programming languages  were  Fortran,  Lisp, and  COBOL.
-   Fortran was designed for scientific and engineering applications, Lisp was designed for  artificial intelligence  research, and COBOL was designed for business applications.
-   These languages were used to write programs that could be executed on computers, which were becoming more widely available at the time.

## Programming Basics: Statements & Functions

-   Programming is the process of writing code to tell a computer what to do.
-   Programs are made up of statements, which are instructions that tell the computer what to do.
-   Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks.
-   Variables are used to store data that can be used by the program.
-   Conditional statements  allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.
-   Loops allow the program to repeat certain actions until a condition is met.

## Intro to Algorithms

-   An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.
-   Algorithms are used in many areas, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering.
-   There are many different algorithms for solving the same problem, and some are more efficient than others.
-   The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its runtime and  memory usage.
-   Big O notation is used to describe the runtime of an algorithm.

## Data Structures

-   Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer program.
-   Some common  data structures  include arrays,  linked lists, stacks, and queues.
-   Each  data structure  has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific needs of the program.
-   Algorithms often use data structures to efficiently process large amounts of data.

## Alan Turing

-   Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist who made important contributions to the development of computing and cryptography.
-   During World War II, Turing worked on breaking  German codes  using a machine called the Bombe.
-   After the war, Turing continued to work on computing and artificial intelligence research.
-   Turing is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modern computing, and his work laid the foundation for many of the technologies we use today.
