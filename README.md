# ComputerScienceBasics

## Early Computing

-   Mechanical devices such as the abacus and  Jacquard loom  were the first computers.
-   Charles Babbage designed the  Analytical Engine, the first programmable machine.
-   Ada Lovelace is credited with creating the first  computer program  for the Analytical Engine.
-   Alan Turing described the  Universal Turing Machine, capable of performing any computation.
-   The first electronic computer,  ENIAC, was built in the 1940s to calculate  ballistic trajectories.

## Electronic Computing

-   The development of the transistor paved the way for the miniaturization of electronic components and the creation of the modern computer.
-   The first commercially successful computer was the  UNIVAC, introduced in the 1950s.
-   IBM dominated the computer industry in the 1960s with its System/360 mainframe computer.
-   The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s allowed for the creation of personal computers.

## Boolean Logic & Logic Gates

-   Boolean logic  is a system of logic based on two values: true and false.
-   Logic gates  are electronic circuits that implement Boolean logic.
-   The three basic logic gates are AND, OR, and NOT.
-   Other logic gates include NAND, NOR, XOR, and  XNOR.
-   Logic gates can be combined to create more complex circuits, such as adders  and  flip-flops.

## Representing Numbers and Letters with Binary

-   Binary is a  number system  based on two values: 0 and 1.
-   Computers use  binary  to represent numbers and letters.
-   ASCII is a standard  encoding scheme  that assigns a unique  binary code  to each character.
-   Unicode is a more comprehensive encoding scheme that supports a wider range of characters and languages.

## How Computers Calculate - the ALU

-   The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a component of the computer that performs arithmetic and  logical operations.
-   The ALU operates on  binary numbers  using logic gates and circuits.
-   The ALU can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and  bitwise operations.
-   The ALU is controlled by the computer's central processing unit (CPU).

## Registers and RAM

-   Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold data temporarily.
-   RAM  (Random Access Memory) is the primary memory of a computer, which can be read from and written to.
-   RAM is volatile, meaning that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off.
-   Accessing data in RAM is slower than accessing data in registers, but much faster than accessing data from secondary storage devices like hard drives.

## The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

-   The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.
-   The CPU consists of an  arithmetic logic unit  (ALU), control unit (CU), and registers.
-   The CU fetches instructions from memory and decodes them into operations the ALU can perform, then sends the results back to memory or registers.
-   The clock speed of a CPU measures how many instructions it can execute per second.

## Instructions & Programs

-   Programs are a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
-   Instructions are encoded in binary and stored in memory.
-   The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the process by which the CPU retrieves instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them.
-   High-level programming languages allow programmers to write code in a more human-readable form, which is then translated into  machine code  by a compiler or interpreter.

## Advanced CPU  Designs

-   Pipelining  is a technique used by modern CPUs to execute multiple instructions simultaneously, by overlapping the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
-   Superscalar processors can execute  multiple instructions  in parallel by having multiple execution units.
-   Branch prediction  is a technique used by modern CPUs to predict which branch of code will be executed next, in order to minimize the number of cycles wasted on incorrect predictions.
-   Cache is a small, fast memory located on the  CPU chip  that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the amount of time spent accessing main memory.

## Early Programming

-   Early programming languages were often low-level and difficult to use, requiring programmers to write instructions in binary or  assembly language.
-   Grace Hopper invented the first compiler, which allowed programmers to write code in a higher-level language that was then automatically translated into machine code.
-   FORTRAN was the first high-level programming language, designed for scientific and engineering applications.
-   COBOL was designed for business applications, while  BASIC  was designed for beginners.
